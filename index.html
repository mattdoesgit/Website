        In Colombia's light, she shines so bright,<br>
        Her beauty glows in the soft moonlight.<br>
        Though miles apart, our love holds true,<br>
        For in my heart, she's always with me, too<br>

            <p>I am a Third Year Physics Student at the University of Cambridge aiming towards building a strong career. I look to develop quantitative skills (detailed in later sections), alongside Machine Learning capability and financial understanding towards a career in a quantitative role. I am consistently looking to buid those skills through computational projects, as well as wider reading (both listed below). Aside from academics, I spend time playing football, guitar, visiting chess clubs and one day hope to own a plant shop.
